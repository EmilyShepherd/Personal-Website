                         OpenPGP Signing Policy           September 2016


1.  Introduction

   This policy is valid for all signatures made since 2016-09-29 by the
   following PGP Key (Figure 1).

   pub rsa4096 2015-09-25 [SC]
       4C8D 7CBA A377 7A9B B0C3 F6FC A91F 7111 D9AF 0B5D

                                 Figure 1

1.1.  Obtaining the Public Key

1.1.1.  Key Servers

   This key has been confirmed to exist from a variety of well connected
   keyservers including, but not limited to:

   o  pool.sks-keyservers.net

   o  pgp.mit.edu

   o  keyserver.pgp.com

   o  pgp.surfnet.nl

1.1.2.  Other Locations

   It is also availiable via HTTP [3] and in textual form from:

   o  https://emilyshepherd.me/emily.asc

   o  https://gist.github.com/EmilyShepherd/e5140a353fa9d0e92c9b

   o  http://pgp2.cs.uu.nl/stats/a91f7111d9af0b5d.html

2.  Signing Levels

   I use the following signature levels:

2.1.  No Answer (0x10)

   This level is used when signing organisational PGP certificates such
   as Facebook Inc (0x2F3898CEDEE958CF) or Tor Browser Developers
   (0x4E2C6E8793298290).

   In these cases, I will have verfied the key's authenticity by
   ensuring that the key exists on a well connected key server and its
   fingerprint is availiable from the organisation's official sources.

2.2.  I have no checked at all (0x11)

   I do not sign at this signature level

2.3.  Casual Checking (0x12)

   This is the default level I will sign at.  This requires that:

   1.  I have met the SIGNEE in person

   2.  The SIGNEE has comfirmed their key fingerprint

   3.  The UIDs which the SIGNEE wishes to be signed meet the criterea
       listed in the UID section.

   4.  The SIGNEE must provide two forms of ID.

2.4.  Careful Checking (0x13)

   This signature level is used for SIGNEEs whom meet the criterea of a
   (0x12) level certificate and with whom I have a personal or
   professional relationship.

3.  UIDs & UATs

3.1.  Names In UIDs

   When signing UIDs containing a name, I will follow CAcert's Policy
   [2] with the exception that I may refuse to foreign names if the
   transliteration used is unknown to me and I am not able to confirm
   their correctness with confidence.

   'Go-By' names / nicknames are acceptable if they are within quotes
   and these are not obviously misleading.  See the following table
   (Table 1) for examples.

             +---------------------+-------------------------+
             | Acceptable Nickname |  Unacceptable Nickname  |
             +---------------------+-------------------------+
             |  Mike "Mikey" James | Mike "Bill Gates" James |
             +---------------------+-------------------------+

3.2.  Emails

   I will require that control over email addresses be verified.

   In the case that the public key contains a usable encryption key,
   control of each email address is validated by the signed key being
   sent to that address, encrypted with the SIGNEE's encryption key.

   Where no encryption key exists, I will send a challenge to each email
   address.  If I get a signed response, that UID will be signed by me
   and emailed back.

   In cases where there are no email address UIDs, or multiple email
   address UIDs, the SIGNEE should arrange with me beforehand where
   signed non-email UIDs should be sent.

3.3.  Images

   If you would like me to sign a photo of you, please print out and
   bring that photo when we meet.

   Please Note: This must be *the same* photo; other photos showing your
   likeness will be ignored.

3.4.  Comments

   Comments are typically ignored unless they make wildly outrageous
   claims.  See the following table (Table 2) for examples.

   +--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   |      Acceptable Comments       |      Unacceptable Comments       |
   +--------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   |     Mike (personal email)      |      Mike (I own Microsoft)      |
   |         mike@gmail.com         |          mike@gmail.com          |
   |                                |                                  |
   |                                |                                  |
   |                                |                                  |
   |      Mike (Yale Address)       |       Mike (Yale Address)        |
   |         mike@yale.com          |         mike@harvard.com         |
   +--------------------------------+----------------------------------+

4.  Key Transition

   If I have signed a key which you have since decided to retire in
   favour of another key (for example, if your old key was revoked or

   you are transitioning to a higher key length) I will not consider
   signing the new key without going over this process again.

   In other words, trust cannot be transfered from one key to another;
   all new keys are treated as new.

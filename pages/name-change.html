      Those of you that grew up with me, or knew me before I went to
      University, will know me as
      <abbr title="Alexander Micheal Shepherd">Alex</abbr>. So what's up
      with the name change? Well, in 2013, after a year or so of
      questioning, I realised my desire to transition to become female.
      I'm now known by my friends, the students' union and the university
      as Emily.

    <h2>So what does this mean?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm transgender, which means I was born in body that doesn't match
      my mind - my sex is male, but my gender is female. Now that I have
      come to terms with this and come out, I ask that people refer to me
      as "Emily" and use female pronouns (her, she, etc).
    </p>
    
    <h2>What about "Shep"?</h2>
    <p>
      Shep has been my nickname for as long as I can remember, and I'm
      still completely happy with it. My friends have also started to
      use "Em" as a nickname.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What if I forget?</h2>
    <p>
      It's completely fine to forget once in a while - especially those
      of you that have known me for a long time. I still respond to
      "Alex" and my old email address (alexander.shepherd@gmail.com). I
      might remind you if you accidentally refer to me as "Alex", but
      please don't take this as I sign that I am upset with you.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Is this "Legal" Yet?</h2>
    <p>
      I've put "legal" in quotation marks because I have the right to
      be referred to with the name / pronouns that are appropriate for
      me. However, I have not formally changed my name yet, so my
      passport / birth certificate still state that I am male. For this
      reason, if you need to use my name in a formal or legal setting
      (eg, for bank transfers), please continue to use "ALEXANDER M
      SHEPHERD" for the meantime.

        <h1>Intro to me</h1>
        <p>
          I am an eager Computer Science undergraduate, currently in my fourth
          year on a master's course University of Southampton, on track for
          achieving first class honours. This degree has introduced me to a
          plethora of concepts and subject areas, such as Graphics, Compiler
          Engineering, Database Design, Operating Systems, Memory Allocation and
          Garbage Collection, to name but a few.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Outside of the course, I work as a freelance web developer and have
          built and managed sites for a variety of charities and profit-driven
          organisations, such as Spa Staff.com.

            In the summer of 2010, I became an intern at their London office. My
            main task was reskinning their web site to look good on iPhones.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In 2011 I was invited to their LA office, to continue as a Web
            Developer. I was tasked with rebuilding their payment systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was during my time at Music Jobs that I got my first taste of
            building mobile web apps, and running a site off Amazon Web
            Services' Elastic Cloud.

            I am currently SpaStaff's only web developer, putting me in charge
            of the upkeep and management of their entire site. Their service has
            thousands of users, so they are continually using my services to
            improve &amp; add new features; the latest of which was rebuilding
            their blog pages, so that they are integrated with Twitter and
            Facebook.

          <p>
            In June of this year, SWEEB took over the hosting of SpaStaff.com. I
            am now responsible for ensuring the site stays live, and that its
            hourly backups run as scheduled.

        <h1>Intro to me</h1>
        <p>
          I am an eager Computer Science undergraduate, currently in my fourth
          year on a master's course University of Southampton, on track for
          achieving first class honours. This degree has introduced me to a
          plethora of concepts and subject areas, such as Graphics, Compiler
          Engineering, Database Design, Operating Systems, Memory Allocation and
          Garbage Collection, to name but a few.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Outside of the course, I work as a freelance web developer and have
          built and managed sites for a variety of charities and profit-driven
          organisations, such as Spa Staff.com.

            I took over the management of
            <a href="https://www.spastaff.com/" target="_blank">Spa Staff.com</a>
            from a professional web
            construction company in 2011, while I was still in Sixth Form. Since
            then, I have been solely in charge of the technical administration
            and development of the site. The site is hosted on an EC2 instance
            in Amazon's Elastic Cloud.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As their web developer, I was responsible for implementing a redesign, from
            their
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110703235306/http://www.spastaff.com/" target="_blank">old look</a>
            to the version which is live today. The site is now responsive, and
            flicks into a "stretchy" design on small screens.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In 2014, Spa Staff contracted a second freelance developer to
            perform petty bug fixes and improvements while I worked on a major
            site redesign. I was put in charge of training this developer in the
            technologies the site uses and assigning / overseeing jobs. This
            was my first experience of acting in a managerial role in a
            commercial group.

            I have been deeply interested in web development for a long time,
            and quickly realised that I could earn money from my passion. I act
            as a freelance web developer under the pseudo-company: <b>SWEEB</b>.

          <p>
            Many of my clients were small charities and individuals without
            any technical knowledge. This has got me well versed in translating
            a user's functional requirements into a technical plan, and
            communicating with clients without resorting to confusing jargon.

            In the summer of 2010, I became an intern at their London office. My
            main task was reskinning their web site to look good on iPhones.

            In 2011 I was invited to their LA office, to continue as a Web
            Developer. I was tasked with rebuilding their payment systems.

            It was during my time at Music Jobs that I got my first taste of
            building mobile web apps, and running a site off Amazon Web
            Services' Elastic Cloud.

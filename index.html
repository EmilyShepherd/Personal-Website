        <p>
          I am a 4<sup>th</sup> <a href="#uni">Computer Science student</a> at the University of Southampton, on track for
          first class honours. The degree has introduced me to a
          plethora of concepts and subject areas, including: Low Level Graphics, Compiler
          Engineering, Database Design, Operating Systems and Memory Allocation, to name but a few.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Outside of the course I work as a <a href="#sweeb">freelance web developer</a> and have
          built and managed sites for a variety of non-profit groups, such as theatre groups,
          local residents associations and charities, and also commercial
          organisations such as <a href="#spastaff">Spa Staff.com</a>,
          <a href="#musicjobs">UK Music Jobs</a> and Simply D'nA.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When not coding, I like to exercise by hill walking, a
          passion I have loved since completing the Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award. I have also been
          heavily involved in the Students' Union, acting as a course representative,
          running the Nightline Listening Service and fighting for trans* rights.

            I took over the management of
            <a href="https://www.spastaff.com/" target="_blank">Spa Staff.com</a>
            from a professional web
            construction company in 2011, while I was still in Sixth Form. Since
            then, I have been solely in charge of the technical administration
            and development of the site. The site is hosted on an EC2 instance
            in Amazon's Elastic Cloud.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            As web developer, I was responsible for implementing a redesign, from
            their
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110703235306/http://www.spastaff.com/" target="_blank">old look</a>
            to the version which is live today. The site is now responsive, and
            flicks into a "stretchy" design on small screens.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In 2014, Spa Staff contracted a second freelance developer to
            perform petty bug fixes and improvements while I worked on a major
            site redesign. I was put in charge of training this developer in the
            technologies the site uses and assigning / overseeing jobs. This
            was my first experience of acting in a managerial role in a
            commercial group.

            I have been deeply interested in web development for a long time,
            and quickly realised that I could earn money from my passion. I act
            as a freelance web developer under the brand name: <span class="sweeb">SWEEB</span>.

            Many of my clients were small charities and individuals without
            any technical knowledge. This has taught me to be well versed in translating
            a user's functional requirements into a technical plan, and
            communicating with clients without resorting to confusing jargon.

            In the summer of 2010, I became an intern at their London office. My

            <h2>Nightline</h2>

            <p>
              Southampton Nightline is a confidencial telephone listening service,
              run entirely by student volunteers availiable to anyone at
              the University of Southampton free of charge.
            </p>

            <p>
              I joined in 2013 and immediately recognised the importance
              of the service. I was one of the first volunteers in my
              cohort to reach the "experienced" level, allowing me to
              take calls, aid in training, and oversee others taking
              calls. In early 2014, I was awarded a prize for the most
              number of shifts covered.
            </p>

            <p>
              After only a year at Nightline, I became its head
              (the Nightline Officer) by entire-campus election. This put
              me in charge of all of Nightline's day to day operations,
              such as ensuring the rota was filled, charing the Nightline
              Committee, acting as a point of contact and support for
              our volunteers, and its longer term plans and strategies,
              such as managing the budget and refreshing our constitution
              and confidentiality policies.
            </p>

            <p>As
              call-taking volunteers are anonymous, the Nightline Officer
              is the only "public face" of the organise, meaning I was
              responsible for all of Nightline's public relations. This
              included: representing Nightline at meetings of the Students'
              Union and University, securing funds,
              heading up Nightline's social media presence and publicity
              events on campus, and liaising with the National Nightline
              Organisation.
